This devcontainer is configured to provide you a latest version of FreePascal WASM toolset.

[![Open in GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/codespaces/badge.svg)](https://codespaces.new/wasm-outbound-http-examples/freepascal)

1. Example in `browser-sync-xhr-shortstring` directory allows you to build a FreePascal ShortString-powered browser example (same as demo), 
 and experiment with it.
   For details, see its [README](browser-sync-xhr-shortstring/README.md).
   Also [browser demo](https://wasm-outbound-http-examples.github.io/freepascal/sync-xhr-shortstring/) is available.
